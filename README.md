# Sales Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

Project Overview:
Sales Prediction is a crucial element in business strategy, enabling informed decisions on advertising expenditure. This project, implemented in Python, leverages machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model based on advertising expenses (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The aim is to empower businesses in optimizing resource allocation and enhancing advertising strategies for increased sales impact.

Key Features:
Data Exploration: The project explores a dataset with 4 features (TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales) to understand the relationship between advertising expenses and sales figures.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizing the power of simple linear regression, the project builds a predictive model to forecast future sales based on advertising expenditure.

Data Source: The dataset, comprising 200 observations, is collected from Kaggle. Another dataset with 6 features and 2935849 observations is also included for broader analysis.

Characteristics of Data:
The dataset, free of null values, provides a robust foundation for analysis. The features represent advertising expenses on different platforms, and the corresponding sales figures are used for training and evaluating the predictive model.

Software and Tools:
The project is implemented in Python, using Jupyter Notebook as the primary environment. Key libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, are employed for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.
Execute the cells to run the analysis and build the predictive model.
